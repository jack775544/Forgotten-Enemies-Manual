      <P>Announcing the public release and general availability of the Forgotten 
      Enemies Expansion modification for Battlezone II.<BR>In the summer of 2000 
      a community of Battlezone II players began working together on a 
      modification to the game that would feature new races, new technologies, 
      and a full-blooded single-player campaign. With literally thousands of 
      hours of collaborative community effort, and with the creative 
      contributions of volunteer designers, modelers, musicians, storytellers, 
      voice recorders, and organizers, our monumental effort is now entering its 
      last stages. The Forgotten Enemies expansion modification is released. 
      <BR><IMG height=497 src="BZ2CP  Forgotten Enemies_files/poster.jpg" 
      width=500 align=left border=0> We invite you to download and play our free 
      major modification to the Battlezone II game, and the logical extension of 
      the storyline that started with Battlezone 1. These are just SOME of the 
      features of our mod: <BR>Enjoy all the graphic glory, new models, weapons, 
      worlds, and special effects that we could possibly pack in a download of 
      about 250 MB, including a full off-line manual. <BR>Sit back and relax as 
      a painless installer for the game gets it going for you. To switch back to 
      normal Battlezone II at any time, exit the game and double-click a 
      different program icon. <BR>Select your game choices using our new 
      Forgotten Enemies shell, complete with fresh graphics and music. 
      <BR>Master combat against or in the role of a brand new race - the Hadeans 
      - with new technologies and an entirely new complete build tree. <BR>Pilot 
      two new vehicles, the Hammer and the Brawler, for the ISDF and Scions 
      respectively. <BR>Shoot or get nailed by absolute loads of new weapons, 
      and watch your target explode violently in just one of the many enhanced 
      special effects we?ve introduced to the game. <BR>Play through the 
      missions of an over twenty-mission single-player campaign, watch as the 
      challenge begins to mount after the first mission, and get hungry for 
      more! <BR>Deploy recyclers that are now capable of defending themselves! 
      <P>Fight your enemies on brand new worlds, with new indigent life forms, 
      in over twenty-five Multiplayer Instant Co-operative, Deathmatch and 
      Strategy maps. If you want, play with FE ships on converted versions of 
      the Battlezone II multiplayer maps. Then, take a breath from the fierce 
      multiplayer action with several Instant Action maps we?ve also managed to 
      squeeze in. 
      <P>Try not to take too many jet rides into the sky in our brand new MPI 
      experience, as you fight against computer-allied races. Watch as Scion and 
      ISDF AI forces now team up to invade your base and work together to kill 
      you dead! We believe the quality of this release, which builds on the 
      incredible game Pandemic originally provided, will make Battlezone II: 
      Forgotten Enemies an experience that any gamer must see and play to 
      believe. 
      <P>Are you READY for Forgotten Enemies? 
      <P>You?d better be. Because they?re ready for you. 
      <P>And they?re not in a good mood. </FONT></FONT></P></FONT></TD></TR>
