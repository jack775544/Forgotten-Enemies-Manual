<P>
Announcing the public release and general availability of the Forgotten Enemies Expansion modification for Battlezone II.<br>
In the summer of 2000 a community of Battlezone II players began working together on a modification to the game that would feature new races, new technologies, and a full-blooded single-player campaign. With literally thousands of hours of collaborative community effort, and with the creative contributions of volunteer designers, modelers, musicians, storytellers, voice recorders, and organizers, our monumental effort is now entering its last stages. The Forgotten Enemies expansion modification is released.
<br>

We invite you to download and play our free major modification to the Battlezone II game, and the logical extension of the storyline that started with Battlezone 1. These are just SOME of the features of our mod: 
<br>
Enjoy all the graphic glory, new models, weapons, worlds, and special effects that we could possibly pack in a download of about 250 MB, including a full off-line manual. 
<br>
Sit back and relax as a painless installer for the game gets it going for you. To switch back to normal Battlezone II at any time, exit the game and double-click a different program icon. 
<br>
Select your game choices using our new Forgotten Enemies shell, complete with fresh graphics and music. 
<br>
Master combat against or in the role of a brand new race - the Hadeans - with new technologies and an entirely new complete build tree. 
<br>
Pilot two new vehicles, the Hammer and the Brawler, for the ISDF and Scions respectively. 
<br>
Shoot or get nailed by absolute loads of new weapons, and watch your target explode violently in just one of the many enhanced special effects we’ve introduced to the game. 
<br>
Play through the missions of an over twenty-mission single-player campaign, watch as the challenge begins to mount after the first mission, and get hungry for more! 
<br>
Deploy recyclers that are now capable of defending themselves! 
<p>
Fight your enemies on brand new worlds, with new indigent life forms, in over twenty-five Multiplayer Instant Co-operative, Deathmatch and Strategy maps. If you want, play with FE ships on converted versions of the Battlezone II multiplayer maps. Then, take a breath from the fierce multiplayer action with several Instant Action maps we’ve also managed to squeeze in. 
<p>
Try not to take too many jet rides into the sky in our brand new MPI experience, as you fight against computer-allied races. Watch as Scion and ISDF AI forces now team up to invade your base and work together to kill you dead! We believe the quality of this release, which builds on the incredible game Pandemic originally provided, will make Battlezone II: Forgotten Enemies an experience that any gamer must see and play to believe. 
<p>
Are you READY for Forgotten Enemies? 
<p>
You’d better be. Because they’re ready for you. 
<p>
And they’re not in a good mood.
