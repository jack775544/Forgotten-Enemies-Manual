<P>The really substantial change to Strat games involves the addition of the 
Hadean race. You will find that the Hadeans have a unique build tree with 
totally new and different buildings, ships and weapons. In FE, it will be 
possible and often necessary to adopt different styles of gameplay both as a 
Hadean and against a Hadean. You will be able to play as a member of the ISDF or 
as a Scion and the units, weapons, and techniques that you have learned/utilized 
for stock BZII version 1.2 games will be quite useful. However, you will also 
have the opportunity to play a different type of game <I>even if you are not 
including Hadeans as a race in a particular game</I>. It is possible to play 
games in a manner similar to games in BZII version 1.2 without some of the 
annoying problems such as seeing or possessing "unhittable flying Mortarbikes", 
useless Turrets, or shift scouts easily dodging guntower ordnance. If you play 
as a Scion, no longer will you be lacking a late-game long-range "power-unit". 
</P>
<P>Forgotten Enemies adds a novel feature to Strat games. In a created game 
room, the host has a new option to activate a recycler defense mechanism that 
severely deters attempts to win a game with an "early base rush". If you wish to 
ensure that neither team is capable of winning a game before at least the 
mid-game (with sabres), then the host should activate this option. The 
<B>RecDef: ON/OFF</B> feature is clearly visible to all in the game room shell. 
It's worth noting that many of the more experienced players diasgree with the 
recdefense option, in the opinion that scouts should be part of the base-attack 
game, not just the dogfights. This option, however, is very useful for new 
players or imbalanced games, since it'll make sure the match lasts at least 10 
minutes in most situations.</P>
<P>The skill levels of all turrets and gun towers have been increased in 
Forgotten Enemies. Gun towers are set to <B>skill level 2</B>, and have their 
shot speed greatly increased. All turrets operate at <B>skill level 3</B>. Thus, 
the usefulness of defensive units is substantially greater in primary bases and 
in the field.</P><B><I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Implications</P></I></B>
<P>Since AI defensive skills for all races have been increased, Forgotten 
Enemies games on average will likely last longer than version 1.2 games. This is 
a consideration when electing whether or not to activate recycler defenses. 
Unfortunately, once the game launches, one cannot at some point during the game 
turn off those additional defensive units. Thusly, if everyone in the room is of 
the same mind and would favor a tighter game, then there is that option to leave 
recycler defenses off.</P>
<P>Now that turrets are more useful, one can consider sending them in groups 
into the field, say, to protect a pool area. There was a time when BZII turrets 
were useful outside of one?s base. However, experienced players soon learned 
that turrets are wasted in most cases against veterans in BZII games if they are 
moved out of the primary base perimeter. In Forgotten Enemies, the value of 
turrets relative to player abilities has been partly reestablished. There are 
still players capable of destroying FE turrets without being hit, but it is 
substantially harder, and usually takes longer to acheive. The most obvious of 
these tactics is hovering directly above the turret, out of it's firing range. A 
good rule of thumb with turrets is always to have them backing each other up, 
around 40m apart. This way, they will protect each other from such tactics, and 
have to be destroyed by brave 'bullet taking' attacks, or long-range 
weaponry.</P>
<P>Gun Towers and their counterparts are quite useful. If you want to "wobble 
kill" with a chain scout, then you may end up making a scrap donation to the 
other team. Although towers too can be destroyed by skilled players in scouts, 
once again it's not as easy as it used to be, helping newbies and taking vet 
skills to another level alike. Consider using gun towers along with turrets to 
secure pool areas as well as your base.</P>
<P>As players improved with version 1.2, it became evident that units that could 
be built relatively early in the game became preferred vehicles to utilize to 
the bitter end. It has only been in recent months that the value of tanks with 
proper load-outs has been rediscovered. There was a time when veterans could 
tell that the other side was comprised of novices if those opponents even 
bothered to waste the scrap making tanks at all. Forgotten Enemies has been 
designed such that it will be difficult to win a game as a "one-man army" in a 
relatively light unit. When veteran players are defending their bases well, you 
will often need to consider building the larger assault units in order to take 
out the intrinsically heavier defensive units.</P>
<P>As has been the case with other versions of Battlezone II, heavy assault 
units can be relatively vulnerable to attack by lighter and more agile vehicles. 
Think about utilizing the increased defensive capabilities of turrets before you 
move out a heavy assault unit for attacking. "Walking" three or four turrets 
along with a heavy vehicle can work wonders to protect that unit from close-up 
destruction by lighter vehicles. And don?t forget to take along multiple repair 
trucks because you will no doubt need them for ammo replenishment and for 
maintenance of your hull integrity.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
